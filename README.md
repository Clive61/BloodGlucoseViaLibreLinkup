I created this project to show my Blood Glucose level on my iMac computers menu bar. 
It links to my Libre Link Up account via their API's. 
Please use it if its any help. 
It also uses SimpleKeychain package. 
To use just compile the source in xcode. Then click on the menu item and enter your Libre LinkUp account details.
Your data is only read and displyed to yourself via this app.
